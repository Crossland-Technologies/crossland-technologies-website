                        of automating a task should be weighed against the solution required.</p>

                        <p>The first step is to generate a conceptual design.</p>
                        <p>A conceptual design is a high level description of your idea and how it works; we want to get what's in your brain on to paper.</p>
                        <p>The scope and size of the conceptual design depends upon;
                        <ul>
                            <li>the size of your organisation,</li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Conceptual designs are a crucial first step as they allow all stakeholders to operate from a common point.</p>
                        <p>For entrepreneurs and inventors conceptual deigns can provide credibility and legitimacy with investors.</p>
                        <p>For project managers conceptual designs provide re-assurance to stakeholders.</p>
                        <p>Our experience shows that getting the conceptual design right at the start is crucial for success.</p>
                        <p>Our conceptual design service consists:
                            <ol>
                                <li>A kick-off meeting (face-to-face or video call) where we will discuss your idea.</li>
                                <li>We will send you your tailored conceptual design questionnaire.</li>
                                <li>Once the questionnaire is returned, we will produce your conceptual design.</li>
                                <li>You then get chance to review your new conceptual design.</li>
                                <li>We will update your design with any comments you may have.</li>
                                <li>With your conceptual design you're ready to approach the world to make your idea a reality.</li>

                        <p>We produce 3D imagery, animations and videos to help you clearly and concisely convey your idea.</p>
                        <p>We highly recommend you to use 3D artwork supports your conceptual design.</p>

                            <ol>
                        <li>The first step is to model your product or idea in 3D, this means getting the physical dimensions correct.</li>

                        <li>Once you approve the model dimensions we can work on appearance; get the colours and textures correct.
                            <ul>
                                <li>How far you go with the aesthetics of the model is personal preference, our guidance is to remember the purpose of the 3D artwork.</li>
                                <li>If the intention is to give a sense of scale or function only then aesthetics are not as important.</li>
                                <li>If the intention is for the model to be used in a product video then aesthetics are extremely important.</li>

                        <li>Once the physical dimensions are correct, should you wish, you can also have your model 3D printed (full size or small scale).</li>
                        <li>
                            With the model dimensionally and aesthetically correct we can then use the model to produce the artwork you require:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Static images and/or diagrams (typically used to support conceptual design.)</li>
                                <li>Product placement images, where we place your 3D model into real photographs. (Typically used for investors & stakeholders, but
                                also give a useful sense of scale.)</li>
                                <li>Animations, demonstrating how your idea works or is assembled. (Especially useful if the workings/assembly are not immediately apparent.) </li>
                                <li>Product Video, advertising your idea. (Typically used for websites and attracting customers).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>As well as individual discrete items we can also create scenes and background objects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static background images again can be used to give a good sense of scale.</li>
                            <li>Live construction plans -  when updated regularly the 3D scene can be used to determine implementation routes and installation orders
                                (e.g. process pipework and ducting).</li>
                            <li>Scene animations can convey construction order and/or fly by views.</li>
                            <li>Walkthrough videos can be created to show exactly how the final idea or concept will be implemented.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>

                    </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>3D artwork not only gives a sense of legitimacy that does not come from 2D drawings but they can also be truly efficient means of
                            conveying your idea to others.</p>

                        <p>It doesn't matter how well written a piece of text is, sometimes, it's just easier to draw it. A good drawing will

                        <p>Our 2D artwork services are typically used to support conceptual design where clear, concise and accurate

                        <h2>Technical Design</h2>
                        <p>Our technical design service provdes you with the expertise you need to get your system automated, from consultation to documentation.
                            As with the conceptual design, the size of your design package will depend greatly upon the size, scale and
                            complexity of your idea as well as the industry within which you operate.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the conceptual design which is concerned with explaining the idea, our technical design services are concerned with implementation
                        - the hows and the whats:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How will the item be constructed.</li>
                            <li>How will the system and sub systems perform their function.</li>
                            <li>How will the item be operated.</li>
                            <li>How will the system respond to failure.</li>
                            <li>What materials are required.</li>
                            <li>What safety systems are required.</li>
                            <li>What is acceptable (pass) what is not acceptable (fail).</li>
